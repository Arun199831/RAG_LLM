In doing so, they pass on these traits to the next generation. Over time this process allows organisms to adapt to their environment. This is because the frequency of genes for favourable traits increases in the population.\", \"Members of a species are not all alike, partly because of differences in heredity (genetics). This is true even with children of the same parents. Some of these differences might make one organism better at surviving and reproducing than others in a particular habitat. When this organism reproduces, its children get the genes, which gave it the advantage. Some adaptations are extremely long-lasting, useful in many habitats. The evolution of wings in birds environment stays the same. If the environment changes enough, then another organism might do better.\"]}')"

The word Datta means \"Given\", Datta is called so because the divine trinity have \"given\" themselves in the form of a son to the sage couple Guru Atri and Mata Anusuya. He is the son of Guru Atri, hence the name \"Atreya.\" In the Nath tradition, Dattatreya is seen as an Avatar or incarnation of the Lord Shiva and as the Adi-Guru (First Teacher) of the Adi-Nath sampradaya of the Nathas. Although Dattatreya was at first a \"Lord of Yoga\" with Tantric traits, he was adapted and assimilated into the more devotional cults; while still worshiped by millions of Hindus, he is approached more as a benevolent God than as a teacher of the highest essence of Indian thought. Though the Dattatreya of the Natha tradition coexisted and intermingled with the Puranic, Brahmanical tradition of the Datta sampradaya, here we shall focus almost exclusively on the earlier Tantric manifestation of Datta. Shri Gurudev Mahendranath had no doubt that Dattatreya was an historical figure. He stated that Datta was born on Wednesday, the fourteenth day of the full moon in the month of Margasirsa, though he does not mention the year.')"

Similarly, a neural network is made up of cells that work together to produce a desired result, although each individual cell is only responsible for solving a small part of the problem. This is one method for creating artificially intelligent programs. Neural networks are an example of machine learning, where a program can change as it learns to solve a problem. A neural network can be trained and improved with each example, but the larger the neural network, the more examples it needs to perform well—often needing millions or billions of examples in the case of deep learning. There are two ways to think of a neural network. First is like a human brain. Second is like a mathematical equation."

            "text/markdown": "Deep learning is a type of machine learning that helps computers learn to perform tasks by using structures called neural networks, which are inspired by how human brains work. In simple terms, think of deep learning as a way for computers to recognize patterns and make decisions, much like how we learn from experiences.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how deep learning works:\n\n1. **Neural Networks**: A neural network is made up of many layers of small processing units called neurons. Each neuron plays a tiny part in solving a problem. The network usually has an input layer (where data enters), one or more hidden layers (where processing happens), and an output layer (where the result is produced).\n\n2. **Learning Process**: The computer learns by being shown many examples of a task. For instance, to teach it to recognize pictures of cats, you show it thousands of cat images. As it sees more examples, it adjusts how it processes the information to improve its accuracy.\n\n3. **Layers Make It Deep**: Deep learning networks are often called \"deep\" because they can have many hidden layers—sometimes dozens or even hundreds. The more layers there are, the more complex patterns the network can learn. Each layer helps transform the raw data into higher-level features, gradually making it easier for the network to understand what it is looking at.\n\n4. **Types of Learning**: The learning can be of three types:\n   - **Supervised Learning**: Where the computer learns from labeled examples, like knowing that a specific image is a cat.\n   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Where the computer finds patterns in data without being given specific labels.\n   - **Semi-Supervised Learning**: A mix of the two, using both labeled and unlabeled data.\n\n5. **Real-World Usage**: Deep learning is particularly good at tasks that are simple for humans, like recognizing speech, understanding images, or reading handwriting. However, these tasks can be challenging for computers to learn without deep learning techniques.\n\nIn summary, deep learning allows computers to learn in a way that's somewhat similar to how humans learn, by using layers of artificial neurons to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns."
